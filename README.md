# Gate_Sizing
This project optimizes gate sizing using geometric programming (GP) with GPkit and MOSEK. Since the global optimum transistor sizes are in decimal values, a greedy algorithm discretizes them while maintaining area efficiency. Using ISCAS '85 circuits, the design achieves minimum delay with a 10% relaxation, ensuring practical transistor sizing.
